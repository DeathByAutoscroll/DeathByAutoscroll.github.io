# WARNING: VIEWING THIS REPO MAY SPOIL YOUR ENJOYMENT OF CERTAIN CASES I AM INVOLVED WITH.

Hello, this is the repo I'll use to host files, mostly for Ace Attorney Online cases.

These case files assets are mixed into each other with identifiable filenames (as I can't handle obfuscated filenames). Looking at 1 characters set MAY SPOIL ANOTHER CASE THAT USES THE SAME CHARACTER OR ASSETS.

Please do not hotlink from this repo, if you have permission to use these assets please download and rehost them yourself elsewhere.
